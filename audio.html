<h1>Lossless and Lossy Audio</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Lossless Audio Files</h2>
<h3>Examples of Lossless File Types</h3>
<p>WAV, AIFF, FLAC, ALAC and Apple Lossless are all lossless audio files.</p>
<h3>Why Use Lossless File Formats?</h3>
<p>It is best to use lossless audio files if you have recorded your own audio and are keeping a file to archive. It is also good to rip audio to a lossless format so you have a high quality recording which you can then save copies in a lossy format if you choose.</p>

<h2>Lossy Audio Files</h2>
<h3>Examples of Lossy File Types</h3>
<p>MP3 is the most widely known and used lossy audio file. Other file types include AAC, Ogg Vorbis and WMA</p>
<h3>How does lossy compression work?</h3>
<p>Humans are not able to hear very high frequencies and very low frequencies. These are discarded in lossy formats. Some lossy formats discard very quiet sounds that the listener is unlikely to notice, especially in loud parts of a song.</p>
<h3>Why Use Lossy File Formats?</h3>
<p>Lossy formats such as MP3 are compatible with most players. Sound quality is still good so you will not notice any difference in quality unless you are in an ideal environment with top end equipment.</p>
