<h1>Lossy and Lossless Images</h1>
<hr>

<h2>The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</h2>
<h3>Lossy Compression</h3>
<p>This type of compression reduces the size of the image by removing some data from it. This will generally effect the quality of the image quality. By reducing the quality so much it can make the picture look pixelated, and no one likes a pixelated picture. </p>
<h3>Lossless Compression</h3>
<p>This type of compression reduces the size of the image by changing the way in which the data is stored. Therefore this type of compression will make no changes to your image. Your image will be high quality and everyone likes a high quality image.</p>
<h2>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h2>
<p>So users can download picture files from the website quickly and are not waiting 5 hours for the picture to load. It is also important to make sure that the image looks good and is not highly compressed. Web designers may also compress images because they don't want visitors to leave their website because the page takes forever to load.</p>
<h2>The effects of lossy and lossless compression</h2>
<p>Lossy compression will effect the quality of the website because the quality of the images have been reduced. If the images on your website are poor quality people will stop visiting your site because it looks ugly.</p><br>
<p>Lossless compression will effect the quality of a website beause the images will appear to be high quality even after being compressed to a very small size. The website will load quickly and the images will look great.</p>
